# Getting Started with Arduino

This project demonstrates how to use *Arduino Starter Kit* implementing **fairy lights**. The project is divided into stages, each stage reasonably complicates the previous one - from the simplest blinky program up to the complex 4-mode 4-color prototype.

For this project *Arduino 1.6.6* has been used. Program code has been tested using online electronics lab at [circuits.io](https://123d.circuits.io).

The project is made up of six stages. The final stage exists in two variants:

- *stage_06* - the final stage for electronics lab test board *Arduino UNO* (shown on the picture below)
- *stage_06-leonardo* - the final stage for real test board *Arduino Leonardo* (like *Arduino UNO*, but with **ATmega32u4**)

Original test board model was at [Autodesk Circuits](https://123d.circuits.io/circuits/1190100-72-is_vvv_4s-2015_hwprog), but as for now (2017/11/23) it seems to be obsolete (requires project migration to Tinkercad).
